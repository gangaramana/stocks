MR James O'Shaughnessy 

founder and chairman of asset management

* applied 2 strategies
     1) corner stone growth
     2) corner stone value

* these are risky as these does not have debt factor,profitability,assest factor

1)corner stone growth has 4 strategies 
     i)  mcap between 4k and 25k
     ii) EPS(Earning per share) should be growing for the last 5 years(reject if anything does not satisfy)
                              = profit/total shares

               * see if EPS increases y is it due to debt or not(moneycontrol.com)
     
     iii) price to sales ratio < 1.5
         a valuation ratio           =     share price             mcap
                                       -------------------  ==     --------------
                                       sales per share                sales



          if pricetosales ration is 5 then investors are willing to pay 5rupees for 1 rupee of the sale


    iv) arranged all of these companies by divident yield = divident per share
                              						    	------------------
                              							   Market price per share




 pros                                                   cons

                                      * comapnies not giving dividents now






2) corner stone value has 3 criterias
   
    i)  company must be a large cap company(70k+)
    ii) cashflow per share should be grater than the market    

        formulae =  Net cash generated from operating activities
                     --------------------------------------------
                     no of shares


    iii) last years sale should be more than 1.5 times the market average

          take the average sales of some companies in that industry
